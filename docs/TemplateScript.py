# Python stuff
# The function properties still work if you change the function names.
# For example:
#   def onEvent(name, v1, v2):
#       # value 1 is the camera flash length, value 2 is the flash color
#       if name == 'flashCamera':
#           cameraFlash('camGame', v2, v1)
#
# The functions still work, its just with different function names.
