# Ensures the hxcpp haxelib is set to the git checkout (FunkinCrew fork)
# that setup\windows.bat installs. The git version is REQUIRED on Windows MSVC:
#
#   * It supports hxcpp's <assembler> element, so libffi's .asm files (used by
#     hxluau) get assembled with ml64.exe. hxcpp 4.3.2 lacks this -> the .asm
#     files are silently ignored -> linker error LNK1181 "win64.obj".
#   * It honors the HXCPP_CPP17 haxedef that hxluau's haxelib.json emits, so
#     Luau sources are compiled with /std:c++17. hxcpp 4.3.2 ignores that
#     define and uses MSVC's default (C++14) -> errors C7525 / C2039 on
#     std::string_view and inline variables.
#
# A later `haxelib install <something>` can flip the active hxcpp back to a
# release such as 4.3.2; this script restores the intended git checkout.
#
# Idempotent. Run AFTER setup\windows.bat, before building.
# Usage (from repo root):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup\windows-msvc-fix.ps1
